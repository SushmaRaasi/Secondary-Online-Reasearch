### Project Description
###### About the Data Operations Team
<p>Data Operations Team performs secondary research online and gathers relevant information about private companies per the team’s methodologies. Each company’s information is stored in a profile identified by ProfileID. Profiles are tracked as Private Equity (PE), Venture Capital (VC), Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A), etc., based on the company’s backing. On each profile, multiple workflows are worked on by the researchers in the data operations teams. Researchers belong to various research groups with expertise in understanding details about a company’s corporate decisions like fundraising, industry group changes, etc. Each workflow is created by an automated system or by other researchers who find more information about the company. Time taken to complete the workflow is tracked in seconds, and the amount of data added to the profile is tracked as benchmark points. Workflows are categorized based on the information that is being tracked, e.g., if it is a new profile where the company has raised funding, a New Company workflow is created. If an existing company (in our database) raises money, then a New Round workflow is created, and so on. Workflow is also tagged with the various process types that indicate from which team the data is coming from, e.g., news (Post News, News), client request (Special Request), product demo (Demo Update), etc., and the regions from where data is gathered, Greater China, Europe, etc. Each workflow goes through various stages, from its creation to closure. As shown below, Sometimes workflows are created with incorrect details or on the wrong profile, which cannot be worked on. Such workflows are “unassigned” by the team that receives them and is completed by a more relevant team.</p>

### Problem Statement
<p>A new Team Leader needs my help to understand his/her better Data Operations Team. I was provided with sample data that a Business Intelligence Analyst encounters daily. Use Power Bi to analyze and interpret the data to help provide useful insights to the TL.</p>

### DataSet
[Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1afSMYCuGOzYVcsHRGvwfGfnxZ-T2V9aZ/view?usp=sharing)

### Approach
<p>For this project I used a mix of techniques. I relied on Microsoft Power BI to visualize data, analyze statistics and clean the data. I chose these methods because they allowed me to get an understanding of the dataset and easy to make decisions for the stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Reasoning for using Analytical Methods
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Power BI for Visualization:</li>
  <p>I went with Power BI because it's like an all-in-one solution. I could do everything from data cleanup to creating eye-catching charts without switching between different tools. It saved me time and helped me see the big picture.
</p>
  <li>Challenges and Limitations:</li>
  <p>Of course, no project is without its hurdles. I had to figure out what to do with missing data, make sure the data was accurate, and choose the best models for the job. Plus, the data had some limitations. Sometimes we didn't have all the pricing history we wanted, or we didn't know everything about consumer behavior. These challenges and limitations were like puzzle pieces that I had to work around to give the best recommendations I could.</p>
</ul>

### Tech-Stack Used
<p>To complete this project, I relied on a combination of tools and software to effectively manage and analyze the data. Here's a breakdown of the tech stack I used:
</p>
<p><i>Microsoft Power BI:</i> This was the star of the show when it came to data visualization and analysis. Power BI's user-friendly interface made it easy for me to explore the data, clean it up, and create insightful visualizations. It's like having a powerful magnifying glass to zoom in on the data's hidden patterns.
